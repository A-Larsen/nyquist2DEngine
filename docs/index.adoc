== About
The Nyquist 2D Engine (N2DE) is a game engine written in C. It is Cross-Platform

https://nyquist2dengine.com/api-index.html[api]. You can checkout the git
repository at
https://importantmsg.xyz/git/?p=nyquist2DEngine.git/.git;a=summary[nyquist2DEngine.git].

[start=4]
. Now you can run the engine with a lua file.

.linux
[source, cmd]
----
./nyquist2DEngine <somefile>.lua
----

.windows
[source, cmd]
----
.\nyquist2DEngine.exe <somefile>.lua
----

You can use the example lua file to see if your install worked.

.linux
[source, cmd]
----
./nyquist2DEngine ../examples/example1.lua
----

.windows
[source, cmd]
----
.\nyquist2DEngine.exe ..\examples\example1.lua
----

.windows

== Running from any directory
Once you've install nyquist2DEngine you can run the program from any direcory by following
these steps.

=== Windows

NOTE: nyquist2DEngine creates a ".res" folder in the directory it is ran in for
game resources. If the N2DE folder has this directory you can feel free to
delete it if you are going to be running the program from any directory because
it will now look for the ".res" folder in the local directory you run the program
from.

. Copy the N2DE to any location you'd like.

. Search "environment variables' in the windows search bar. This should populate
  an option that says "Edit the system environment variables". Open that.

[start=7]
. Find the location you copied the N2DE directory to.

[start=8]
. Hit "OK" several time until you're out of all of the opened windows, lol.

That's it! you're done. You can go to any directory you want and use the
nyquist2DEngine to run a lua script from there. Just make sure your lua script
is in the same directory.
