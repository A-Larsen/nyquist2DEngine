- [x] Create grouping for images, sprites, fonts, etc.. the goupings will be
      saved in a data file named "<start_id>-<end_id>", so that you can free the
      memory for the element when you don't need it and the read the data file
      to put the element back into memory.

     * save format strings on disk. things that change like names, save in
       memory 

- [x] Turn ScreenElement struct into a union?

- [x] nyq.database.init() has a memory leak for Schema and Schmea.kv

- [ ] instead of creating lots of objects in the nyquist2DEngine struct, make
      more translation units (header with c files) with static variables.
